which the letter of Odo refers, must have been
written before the year 1120, i. e. within thirty years
after Becket’s death. Yet, as this letter is not found
in the other MSS. of the Miracula, it strictly proves
no more than that the copyist of Sir Thomas Phillipps’s
MS. considered this collection to be the same which
Odo sent for the use of his friends, as stated in the
letter aforesaid. Still this is one point gained; for
as Sir Thomas Philipps’s MS. was written about the
year 1300, it follows that the collection of Murcum,
which it contains, was considered to be the work of
Benedici, as early as 50¹0 years ago.

To complete the argument, we have the evidence
of our author himself, in page 219, that, previously
to compiling this book of miracles, he had written a
book concerning the Archbishop :

tractum illum sanguinis, dequo et in passione ejus fecimus
mentionem.

‘The inference, which we would endeavour to
establish, is rendered still more forcible from the
non-existence of any other collection of Miracles
than that which we now publish. Five manuscripts,
at least, of them are in existence, all agreeing with
one another. These are ·

A. Bodley MS. No 509, containing only the first 45 chapters.
B. Paris MS. Biblioth. National. (olim Regia),No 5320. io. 69.
(l. Iambeth MS. No 135.

D. Sir Thomas Phillipps's MS.

Ε. I believe at Anas, or at some other Town in Flanders.
